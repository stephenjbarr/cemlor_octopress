I am proud to introduce CEMLOR, the Center for Machine Learning in Operations Research. CEMLOR aims to investigate the intersection of operations research and those areas of computer science which are concerned with big data, machine learning, and online optimization.

The plans for this site are as follows:

  + Discussion of related research
  + Highlight research papers which are relevant
  + Demonstrate math and code to highlight machine learning algorithms in the context of operations management

Machine learning, big data, and online optimization will play an increasingly large role in business operations. It is the goal of CEMLOR to play a leading role in this exciting new research.


Here we go!
